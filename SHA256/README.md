An implementation of SHA-256 acting on a one-time input (rather than
streaming input). This project demonstrates a unique programming
style: heavy bitwise operations on fixed-size chunks of data.

Do not consider these implementations secure. See [FIPS
180-2](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/publications/fips/180/2/archive/2002-08-01/documents/fips180-2.pdf)
