notes:
  - In keeping with the spirit of `tinyprograms` we don't include the Alire package manager files here.
  - You can use the `--in-place` init above or you can work around this and rely on `.gitignore`

  - If you want to use Alire
    - Follow the instructions for downloading and setting up Alire https://alire.ada.dev
    - Run the proofs with `alr gnatprove`.
    - Run the example program with `alr run --args=../_tests/helloworld.bf`.
