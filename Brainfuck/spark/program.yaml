prepare:
  - alr --non-interactive init --bin --in-place spark
  - alr build 
  - alr gnatprove

run: ./bin/spark {PROGRAM}

notes:
  - In keeping with the spirit of `tinyprograms` we don't include the Alire package manager files here.
  - You can use the `--in-place` init above or you can work around this and rely on `.gitignore`

  - If you want to use Alire:
    - Follow the instructions for downloading and setting up Alire https://alire.ada.dev
    - `alr gnatprove` will run the proofs.
    - `alr run --args=../_tests/helloworld.bf` will run the example program.
