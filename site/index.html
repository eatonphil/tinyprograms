      Learning a new language can be hard. Developers go to "Hello
      World" but this is so trivial a program so as to be almost
      useless.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project is a collection of tiny programs that may help you
      learn a language. It is similar to Rosetta Code except that all
      programs here will be <i>implementations</i> and not library calls.
    </p>

    <p>
      Implementations are opinionated and simple, but not necessarily
      idiomatic. Tests are in place for all implementations but they are not
      necessarily 100% bug-free or (in the case of SHA-256)
      secure. Basically, don't use any code here for anything other than to
      as a learning resource.
